### Hi there, I'm Ben ðŸ‘‹ 

Tech enthusiast and recent graduate of the School of Code bootcamp, I'm on a mission to bring my ideas and creativity to life on the web. With a passion for coding and a thirst for knowledge, I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js through self-study, personal projects, and a 16-week intensive bootcamp. I'm a quick learner, a problem solver, and always up for a challenge. You'll most likely find me experimenting with new technologies or working on exciting side projects. Check out my Github repos for a sneak peek of my work.

You can check out my [Portfolio](https://bennyfreemantle.netlify.app/). My projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/bennyfreemantle). And to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-freemantle/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bennyfreemantle) As I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate & learn from other developers, don't hesitate to reach out!

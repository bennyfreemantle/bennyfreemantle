### Hi there, Iâ€™m Ben ðŸ‘‹

Up untill now I have been self teaching myself â€˜web devâ€™. However, recently I have had the privilege of being accepted to join a 16 week intensive bootcamp to pursue my aspirations of becoming a Full Stack Web Developer!

Currently working through the full stack online course called [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). This has taught me lots of new skills. The main one, being able to research for myself effectively to solve a problem.
